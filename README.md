# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

### [Click Here to View](http://jmmabanta.github.io/sort-algo)

A Typescript sorting algorithm visualization tool made with create-react-app.\
_Inspired by [Clément Mihailescu's own visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer)_

## My TODO List

1. ~~Add input to determine randomized data set size~~ ✅
2. ~~Visualize the data set (numbers for now)~~ ✅
3. ~~Add selection and insertion sort algorithm~~ ✅
4. ~~Display sorting as it happens to the displayed data set~~ ✅
5. ~~Layout and aethethic overhaul~~ ✅
6. Implement other sorting algorithms:
   - ~~Merge Sort~~ ✅
   - ~~Bubble Sort~~ ✅
   - ~~Quick Sort~~ ✅
   - ~~Heap Sort~~ ✅

Currently, I feel that this project is complete. Of course, I could always add more algorithms, but I'll leave that for some other time :)

It will also live update and spit out linting errors when you save edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds app for production in the `build` folder.

### `yarn deploy`

Deploys the production build into the public GitHub pages site for all to see!

**NOTES:**

- Make sure you change `"hostname"` in `package.json` to fit the url of your own GitHub page.
- The production build will be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.
  - The `master` branch might not be updated so make sure to push any commits onto that also.
