## Available Scripts

_For anyone who somehow finds this and for some god forsaken reason decided to clone and run this barebones project for nothing._

### `yarn start`

Starts the project in dev mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser to view.\
It will also live update and spit out linting errors when you save edits.

### `yarn build`

Builds app for production in the `build` folder.

### `yarn deploy`

Deploys the production build into the public GitHub pages site for all to see!\

**NOTES:**

- Make sure you change `"hostname"` in `package.json` to fit the url of your own GitHub page.
- The production build will be pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.
  - The `master` branch might not be updated so make sure to push any commits onto that also.
